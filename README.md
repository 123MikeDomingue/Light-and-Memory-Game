Submitted by: **Mike Domingue**

Time spent: **6 and a half** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ðŸ—¸] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ðŸ—¸] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ðŸ—¸] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ðŸ—¸] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ðŸ—¸] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ðŸ—¸] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ðŸ—¸] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ðŸ—¸] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ðŸ—¸ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/summer_internship_for_tech_excellence/prework]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge I encounter in creating this submission is trying to understand the different functions of the code in how all the parts in the light and memory game connect with each other. HTML,CSS and JavaScript are still new to me in learning more about it. I was happy that the pre-work assignment helps you along the way to create light and sound memory game. The function playClueSequence was one of the things that was challenging to understand for me. The foor loop section in playClueSequence was tricky for me to understand because I wasn't too sure how the loop ran for the clue times. I ended up understanding it my writing it down on a piece of paper so I can see what is being looped each time

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Some questions I have about web development is how do you create some sort of debug to see if you have any logical errors in your code even though it runs smoothly? Another question I have is what is a solid layout or plan you should have when it comes to web development? A lot of times people can be kind of afraid of web development because they don't have any ideas on what type of web application to make and what should be the first step to take. Are there also any specific software you should stick to too when it comes to web development?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would work on adding a function that keeps track on how many times I won and how many times I lost.  I would also want to work on a timer that goes by fast so you are not taking too long pressing the buttons.
